# Design system: Moodie

## Creative direction

**Matinee Archive**

Moodie should feel like leaving a repertory screening in the afternoon while the film is still present. It is warm, tactile, culturally literate, and alive with other people. Daylight and quiet neutral surfaces make room for film art; saturated color marks shifts in feeling and social connection.

The public page is expressive and narrative. The signed-in product is calmer, but the response stream still feels inhabited: human writing, film artwork, emotional traces, and occasional reaction photos establish the atmosphere. It must never resemble a streaming catalog, a film-review scorecard, a generic SaaS dashboard, an Instagram clone, or a facial-analysis demo.

The visual story follows the product:

1. A person watches a film.
2. They say what it meant and how it felt.
3. Someone who felt something similar becomes visible.
4. What that person watched next becomes a recommendation.

## Logo slot

The logo is intentionally unresolved.

- Use the text wordmark alone in navigation until the logo direction is chosen.
- Leave `BrandMark` untouched as an unused placeholder; do not turn it into a motif.
- Reintroducing a future mark must not require restructuring navigation.

## Typography

Oxygen remains the only family. The design changes its scale and rhythm, not the font itself.

- Weight 300 carries expressive display lines.
- Weight 700 creates selective emphasis and functional headings.
- Weight 400 carries body copy, posts, metadata, and controls.
- Landing display text uses `clamp()` up to 6rem with a line height near 0.96.
- Product titles remain practical, with a ceiling near 4.5rem.
- Body copy stays between 65 and 72 characters per line with generous line height.
- Metadata is compact but never faint.
- Avoid repeated uppercase eyebrows as section scaffolding.

The interface renders at a deliberate 110% scale so its 100% browser view matches the approved composition. Desktop starts from a 17px root before that scale; mobile uses the same proportional system. Controls remain at least 50px high and touch targets at least 44px.

## Palette

### Light fields

- **Mineral `#D8D6D1`:** public canvas and secondary product field.
- **Mist `#B9C4C0`:** connective social surface and selected state.
- **Chalk `#F4EFE9`:** reading, forms, posts, and high-clarity content.

### Depth fields

- **Ink `#1D2B33`:** primary text, cinematic depth, and footer.
- **Teal `#477B78`:** film atmosphere and meaningful transitions.
- **Blue `#557890`:** melancholy, distance, and cool counterweight.

### Human accents

- **Oxide `#D76358`:** a major emotional field and selective human accent, not the default button color.
- **Fig `#713B42`:** resonance, intimacy, and reaction state.

Default text is Ink on Mineral, Mist, or Chalk. Small text on Teal uses `#FAF8F4`. Chalk on Fig and Ink is approved. Muted copy uses an Ink-derived color such as `#435258`. Oxide and Fig are not decorative confetti.

## Grain and material

Texture behaves like photographic grain, never a visible pattern.

- Use the deterministic monochrome raster tile exposed through `--grain-image`.
- Do not use CSS dots, stripes, paper speckles, fake distress, or animated noise.
- Blend light fields at roughly 8 to 10 percent and saturated fields at 14 to 20 percent.
- Grain sits below content and never reduces text clarity.
- Keep it static.

Section transitions use static SVG diffusion: layered color fields are displaced by fractal noise, feathered at different radii, and allowed to overlap like wet ink travelling through paper fibres. The source and destination colors must visibly mingle at the edge. Do not approximate this with a row of radial gradients, a smooth blurred wave, a geometric divider, or animated blobs.

## Public overview

The logged-out home is a product overview, not a browse surface.

- The approved opening composition is preserved: “Films stay with people differently,” paired with one convincing social response. Its large candid expression photo, small Whiplash poster, response card, copy, and relative placement should not be redesigned during work on sections below it.
- A real poster, first-person note, and reviewed feelings prove the product in the first viewport.
- The page then follows the product story: the private after-film moment, words and direct feeling controls, a familiar person, and the films found through them.
- Show several distinct films and people in the social section. One repeated example cannot explain a discovery network.
- Explain who the product helps and why small choices matter without turning the page into a feature-card grid or marketing checklist.
- The final invitation contains Enter demo and a quieter sign-in action without explaining what the demo does.
- Public navigation contains overview anchors, Sign in, and a quiet Enter demo action.

## Signed-in product

### Home and activity

The signed-in home is an application dashboard, not another piece of the marketing page. It uses a Letterboxd-like film-and-activity density: the account's diary totals, public count, saved count, active films, recent community activity, recent diary entries, and saved films are visible together.

Each activity row keeps together:

- person and follow state;
- first-person response;
- reviewed feelings;
- film poster and title;
- reaction state.

Reaction photos do not control the home layout. They remain available in the composer, diary, member, and film contexts where there is room to treat them as optional media.

### Discover

Lead with films found through people who felt something similar about a shared film. Keep the person and shared film visible in the reason. Do not show ratings, genres, match percentages, or mechanical scoring explanations.

Search and catalog browsing appear below people-led recommendations. Poster rails are allowed there because the hierarchy has already established the social source.

### Diary

Show chronological responses and a restrained summary of feelings, public responses, and saved films. Notes, visibility, date, and emotional trace remain visible. Do not show average ratings, genre taste, or scoring controls.

### Member page

Show a person's public responses, recurring feelings, and films. It should feel like a social diary, not a generic profile or compatibility report.

### Film page

The film is the visual anchor. “How people felt” follows the synopsis. Related catalog films remain secondary.

### Composer

Film selection comes first. The next prompts are “How did it make you feel?” and “What did it mean to you?” Direct sliders and writing are primary. Camera and photo estimates live in a secondary disclosure. An expression photo can be attached through a separate explicit choice.

### Account

Account state, bio, password, and diary counts are task-focused. This page uses the quietest expression of the system.

## Navigation and footer

- Public navigation is a fixed 48px text layer on desktop and 46px on mobile, with no lower border. Its text changes tone with the section beneath it.
- Logged-out: text wordmark, two useful overview anchors, Sign in, and quiet Enter demo.
- The signed-in product does not reuse the public header. Desktop uses a compact Ink navigation rail with Home, Discover, Diary, Add response, profile, and sign out. Mobile turns that rail into a bottom navigation bar.
- Enter demo signs in directly; never display credentials.
- Protected routes return signed-out visitors to the public overview.
- The footer is one compact 88px field with the TMDB mark and the required non-commercial attribution only.

## Motion

Motion should make the page feel continuous and responsive, not staged.

- Lenis supplies restrained smooth scrolling and anchor movement on the public landing page only. Every signed-in route uses native scrolling for a snappier product feel.
- Large visual layers may move at subtly different scroll rates.
- Content reveals once as it enters the viewport with short, low-distance motion.
- Ink diffusion and grain are static. Motion belongs to content and spatial layers, not simulated paper texture.
- Hover motion is limited to a small lift, scale, or color change.
- No scroll locking, autoplay carousels, particles, looping decoration, or long entrance sequences.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` globally; content must appear immediately when reduction is requested.

## Feeling language and colors

The current seven keys remain a temporary implementation constraint:

- Stillness: Mineral and Ink
- Joy: Oxide
- Melancholy: Blue
- Friction: deep Oxide
- Tension: Fig
- Unease: Teal
- Wonder: light Teal and Mist

Do not encode emotion-to-genre rules. Do not use scanning graphics, camera frames, confidence scores, or temporary labels as brand motifs.

## Components

- **Primary button:** Ink with Chalk text in the signed-in product, 8px radius, 50px minimum height. Oxide is reserved for emotional fields and rare emphasis.
- **Secondary button:** Ink or Mist according to the field.
- **Quiet button:** transparent at rest with a local-surface hover.
- **Surface:** 14px maximum radius for grouped state; posters use 2 to 6px.
- **Input:** Chalk or Mineral, visible Ink-derived border, readable placeholder.
- **Focus:** 3px Fig outline with 3px offset on light fields; Chalk on dark fields.
- **Poster:** 2:3 crop, flat at rest, small lift on hover or focus.
- **Loading:** content-shaped skeletons for lists; a compact spinner only for short isolated transitions.
- **Empty state:** one useful next action.
- **Errors:** a specific message and recovery action where possible.

## Copy rules

Use film, response, feelings, note, person, activity, diary, public, private, saved, follow, reaction, and recommendation literally. The `/feed` route remains an implementation detail; the interface calls it Home and labels the actual list Recent activity.

Avoid invented feature names, technical architecture copy, privacy theater, marketing buzzwords, and mechanical explanations. Never claim that Moodie understands, reads, detects, or diagnoses how a person feels.

Use `expression estimate` for the optional analysis adapter. Use `attach photo` for post media. These are different actions.

## Do not

- Reintroduce a dark streaming shell or catalog-first home.
- Add ratings, stars, genre profiles, compatibility percentages, or popularity-first recommendations.
- Use glassmorphism, gradient text, repeated feature-card grids, oversized radii, purple fog, or neon blobs.
- Use visible dot patterns, paper speckles, faux aging, film strips, clapperboards, or decorative camera imagery.
- Put facial analysis, confidence, or privacy proof in the opening screen.
- Hide first-person notes, feelings, recommendation sources, or visibility behind hover.
